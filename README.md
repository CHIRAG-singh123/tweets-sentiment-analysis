advance project for Sentiment analysis using algorithms like GAN, CNN, NLTK and light GBM


# Sentiment Analysis on ChatGPT Tweets with Advanced Machine Learning Models

## 📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on a large dataset of tweets related to ChatGPT. It leverages a variety of **advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms** for both **data augmentation** and **classification** tasks.

Throughout the project, several powerful models and techniques have been used:

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** (Handling missing values, data balancing)
- **Data Augmentation using GAN (CTGAN)** for synthetic tweet generation
- **Classification Models**:
  - **CatBoost Classifier**
  - **LightGBM Classifier**
  - **XGBoost Classifier**
  - **Custom-built CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for multi-class sentiment classification
- **Clustering Techniques**:
  - KMeans Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Visualization**:
  - Correlation Heatmaps
  - Word Clouds
  - Sentiment Distribution Graphs
  - Dendrograms

Additionally, **VADER** sentiment analysis was also used to validate the sentiments from the synthetic samples generated by CTGAN.

## ⚖️ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a cleaned version of ChatGPT-related tweets, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ryosyo0/chatgpt-tweets-sentiment-analysis-clean-data).

The dataset contains fields such as:

- Tweet Text
- Sentiment scores: `negative`, `neutral`, `positive`
- Predicted Sentiment Label
- Date, Retweets, Likes, Replies
- User information: Location, Followers, Following

## 👨‍💻 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Load dataset
   - Fill missing values
   - Encode/convert features
   - Normalize data if needed

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps, Sentiment Trends
   - Word Clouds for each sentiment class

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - **CTGAN** is trained to generate synthetic tweets
   - New data is sampled for model training

4. **Model Training**:
   - CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models are trained
   - A **CNN** model is trained on text features

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Classification Reports
   - Confusion Matrices
   - ROC-AUC Scores
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score

6. **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - KMeans and Hierarchical clustering are applied
   - PCA used for 2D visualization

7. **VADER Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Sentiment distribution using a pre-trained VADER model

## 📊 Results

- Achieved **83%+ accuracy** using CatBoost.
- **GAN-synthesized data** helped to create a larger dataset for training.
- Successfully trained a **CNN model** for multi-class sentiment classification.
- **PCA** and **clustering** provided strong insights into sentiment groupings.
